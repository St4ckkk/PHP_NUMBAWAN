Title: Built-In Superglobal Variables in PHP

What I've learned:
$_SERVER: Contains information about the server and the execution environment.
$_GET: Stores data sent to the script via URL parameters.
$_POST: Holds data submitted through an HTML form using the POST method.
$_FILES: Used for file uploads, containing information about uploaded files.
$_REQUEST: Combines data from $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE, making it a versatile option.
$_SESSION: Manages session variables for storing user-specific data across page requests.
$_ENV: Stores environment variables of the server or system.
$_COOKIE: Manages cookies sent by the client's browser.

Summary: 
Today, I delved into PHP's superglobal variables. 
These essential variables serve various purposes, 
from retrieving user input to managing sessions and server-related information. 
Understanding how to use these superglobals is crucial for building dynamic and interactive web applications in PHP.
